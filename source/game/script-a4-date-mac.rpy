    ## Brief Date Draft ##
    # Art stuffs Eventually, asks you why humans treat
    # humans like this.

    # You go home to your IoT-enabled automated house,
    # and get an electronic backrub.
    # You forget all about the stresses of the day.
    # The budding realization that your relationship
    # with technology is entirely f’ed does not bother
    # you for now.

    # the power blows and your house falls into darkness.
    # The silence is somewhat frightening…
