    ## PERSONALITY ETC ##
    # Mac is creative, innovative, and individualistic
    # but also a bit nervous and emotionally fragile.
    # They are into art and they have a passion for helping others.
    # G3 is (possibly) an Aquarius. Their favorite activities are all
    # art-related, and they are always looking for ways
    # to improve the world around them.
    # They can be overly idealistic
    # and they can become detached from reality at times.
    # They like to read old design books on color theory and stuff.
    # Their favorite color is light blue, and their favorite food
    # is salmon. G3 is 24

    ##  POTENTIAL STORY ##
    # One night, iMac G3 was browsing an art museum catalog
    # and saw a painting called "Aquarius."
    # They felt a strong connection to it and secretly hoped that
    # others saw them like the figure in the painting.
    # G3 decided they wanted to become an artist too,
    # and started using MALâ€™s software library to create digital art.
    # She also became involved in several charities
    # that help improve the world for Aquarii.
