    ### what does the game/mac want you to think about?

## Brief Date Draft ##
# Art stuffs Eventually, asks you why humans treat
# humans like this.
# Use My Computer Likes Me when I speak BASIC stuff
# as evidence
# You go home to your IoT-enabled automated house,
# and get an electronic backrub.
# You forget all about the stresses of the day.
# The budding realization that your relationship
# with technology is entirely f’ed does not bother
# you for now.

#  Bliss overtakes you as your muscles are vibrated
#  according to a programmed sequence.
# If you think about it more, (or chose not to),
# the power blows and your house falls into darkness.
# The silence is somewhat frightening…

## OR ##
# mac tells its story/interests
# you look at clip art and mac
# shows you their generative art

# mac ponders the identity of the artist
# asks, if making an impact on the world
# is the way to define a real life?
# you say:
    # of course not. all sorts of digi life is poss
    # theres plenty of people alive who haven't had an impact!
# mac asks, are we just servants to you?
    # shows my computer likes me when i speak BASIC as evidence
# you squirm out of the question, and eventually head home

# When you are home, in your IoT pad,
# do you think more about it?
    # no, you float off into rumbling massage bliss (vibrates bg/imgs)
    # yes, you alexa-search "what is the relationship between man and computer?"
        # returns marshall mcluhan
        # reads intro to Understanding Media (most of the first paragraph)
        # you drift off to a deep but troubled sleep
