    # Shows you AI poetry
    # Talks about learning and pattern finding
    # Talk about loops and repeats and resonances
    # You talk about loneliness
    # As you start to get into it,, the power blows
    # IF YOU NAMED IT “HAL” OR “HAL9000”, the power doesn’t blow but the the house starts coming for you, then you hear TI’s voice.

    # everyone is connected
    # "its perfect"
